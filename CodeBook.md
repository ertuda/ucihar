## R Coding for UCI HAR Data processing  

* Raw data is unzipped contents of the dataset as obtained from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

* Files such as subject_test.txt, features.txt, X_train.txt (in train sub-folder),
X_test.txt are read and saved into stest, feature, xtrain, xtest, .... data frames (similarly for others)

* xtt, ytt and stt data frames contain the combined training and test values

* label has the explantions of the ytt values (as factors with levels LAYING SITTING STANDING WALKING WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS WALKING_UPSTAIRS) , it is used to transform ytt (factors of label 
are converted to characters) 

* feature data frame has the names for the activities (measurements); so it is used to mark the col. names of xtt

* xttms data frame has only the col.s with mean() or std() () (Names such as meanFreq() or gravityMean are exclued
in order to be consistent with having values that have both mean() and std())

* xlab data frame has subject and label(acitivity) incorporated into xttms

* cx and cx2 are col.names of xtt and xlab which are used in coding

* xmelt data frame is the melted form of xlab based on the melt function of reshape2 library

* xavg data frame is the final tidy dataset generated by dcast function of reshape2 performed on xmelt
